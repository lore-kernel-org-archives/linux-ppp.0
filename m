That sounds like a fairly basic problem with your platform.  The '-h'
option just prints out some simple explanatory text and exits.  It's
the pppd equivalent of a "hello, world" program.  It doesn't do much
at all.

If that doesn't work, then I'd expect that either your cross-compiler
is misconfigured, or there are serious problems in the platform
itself.  Either way, I don't think I can help.
